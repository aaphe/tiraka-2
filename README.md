# Tietorakenteer ja algoritmit - Data Structures and Algorithms
This repo contains graph algorithms written in Data Structures and Algorithms 2 -course in spring 2023. A graph is implemented in the `graph.py` -file and it is used in all of the algorithm projects. The data-directories contain some example graphs as .txt-files, provided by the course staff.
