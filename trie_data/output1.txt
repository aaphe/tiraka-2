Matching P = Ruby
  searching R: [0, 5, o] [3, 5, t] [3, 4, r]
  move from 0 to 21 with character P[0] = R
  searching u: [0, 1, u]
  move from 21 to 22 with character P[1] = u
  searching b: [0, 2, t] [0, 1, b]
  move from 22 to 27 with character P[2] = b
  searching y: [0, 1, e]
  matching failed at 27 with character P[3] = y

Matching P = Olive
  searching O: [0, 5, o]
  move from 0 to 1 with character P[0] = O
